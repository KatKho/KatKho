## 🌍 My Developer's Journey

My journey in technology and development has been a diverse tapestry of experiences. From my initial forays into the world of photography to roles as a pharmacy tech, then diving into academic pursuits in marine biology and informatics, every step was a learning curve. Perhaps the most profound impact came from my service with the US Coast Guard, where I was continually challenged and learned the essence of adaptability and teamwork.

The defining moment that pivoted me towards web development happened during my time at the University of Washington. While I was deeply engrossed in marine biology, an introductory Java class flipped the switch, and I discovered my innate passion for coding.

Today, as a Full-Stack Software Developer, I see every project as an opportunity to not just code, but to solve problems and create value. With a particular interest in the gaming industry and the ever-evolving realm of AI, I aim to merge my passions and create innovative solutions.

### 🎮 Gaming & AI: My Twin Passions

Ever since I can recall, video games have been my escape, my passion, and my window to countless worlds. This love for gaming aligns perfectly with my fascination for AI. I believe that the future of gaming will be significantly influenced by advancements in AI, and I aspire to be a part of this evolution. With projects like "Lorecraft," where I've melded character creation with GPT-3 and AI imaging, I'm steadily working towards this goal.

### 📈 Continuous Growth

The tech realm is ever-changing, and I firmly believe in the mantra of continuous learning. Currently, I'm honing my skills at Code Fellows, specializing in Full-Stack JavaScript. Yet, this is just a step in my perpetual journey of growth and discovery.
