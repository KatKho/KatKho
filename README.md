## üåç My Developer's Journey

My journey in technology and development has been a diverse tapestry of experiences. From my initial forays into the world of photography to roles as a pharmacy tech, then diving into academic pursuits in marine biology and informatics, every step was a learning curve. Perhaps the most profound impact came from my service with the US Coast Guard, where I was continually challenged and learned the essence of adaptability and teamwork.

The defining moment that pivoted me towards web development happened during my time at the University of Washington. While I was deeply engrossed in marine biology, an introductory Java class flipped the switch, and I discovered my innate passion for coding.

Today, as a Full-Stack Software Developer, I see every project as an opportunity to not just code, but to solve problems and create value. With a particular interest in the gaming industry and the ever-evolving realm of AI, I aim to merge my passions and create innovative solutions.

## üéÆ Gaming & AI

Ever since I can recall, video games have been my escape, my passion, and my window to countless worlds. This love for gaming aligns perfectly with my fascination for AI. I believe that the future of gaming will be significantly influenced by advancements in AI, and I aspire to be a part of this evolution. With projects like "Lorecraft," where I've melded character creation with GPT-3 and AI imaging, I'm steadily working towards this goal.

## üìà Continuous Growth

The tech realm is ever-changing, and I firmly believe in the mantra of continuous learning. Having recently graduated from Code Fellows with a focus on Full-Stack JavaScript, I've taken a significant step in my journey. Currently, I'm expanding my skillset further by pursuing the Google UX Design Certificate, diving into the intricacies of user experience and interface design. This ongoing journey of learning and discovery is not just about acquiring new skills but about evolving my perspective and approach to problem-solving in the dynamic tech landscape.
