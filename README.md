## üåç My Developer's Journey

My journey in technology and development has been a diverse tapestry of experiences. From my initial forays into the world of photography to roles as a pharmacy tech, then diving into academic pursuits in marine biology and informatics, every step was a learning curve. Perhaps the most profound impact came from my service with the US Coast Guard, where I was continually challenged and learned the essence of adaptability and teamwork.

The defining moment that pivoted me towards web development happened during my time at the University of Washington. While I was deeply engrossed in marine biology, an introductory Java class flipped the switch, and I discovered my innate passion for coding.

Today, as a Full-Stack Software Developer, I see every project as an opportunity to not just code, but to solve problems and create value. With a particular interest in the gaming industry and the ever-evolving realm of AI, I aim to merge my passions and create innovative solutions.

I believe that the future of gaming will be significantly influenced by advancements in AI, and I aspire to be a part of this evolution.
